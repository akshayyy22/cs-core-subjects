## Data Transmission

**Definition:**  
Data transmission involves sending raw binary bits (0s and 1s) from one device to another over a physical medium, converting digital data to signals (electrical, optical, or electromagnetic).[1][2]

**Types:**  
- **Serial Transmission:** Sends bits one after another; used in most communication (e.g., USB, network links).
- **Parallel Transmission:** Sends multiple bits simultaneously across several wires; mainly within computers.[1]

**Modulation/Encoding:**  
Digital data is encoded into signals using schemes like Manchester or NRZ encoding; modulation (AM, FM, QAM) adapts the data for the medium.[2][1]

**Interview Q:**  
Q: What is the main function of the Physical Layer?  
A: It transmits raw binary data over a physical medium, handling signal encoding, electrical specs, and data rates.[2]

**Edge Cases:**  
- Signal attenuation may require repeaters.
- Electromagnetic interference (EMI) and crosstalk can corrupt signals, especially in parallel transmission.[3][2]

## Bandwidth

**Definition:**  
Bandwidth is the range of frequencies or capacity of a transmission medium, defining the max rate of data transfer, measured in bits per second (bps), Kbps, Mbps, or Gbps.[2]

**Role:**  
Higher bandwidth allows more data to be sent per second, improving throughput.

**Bit Rate:**  
The actual number of bits sent per second; may be lower than bandwidth due to noise, encoding inefficiency.

**Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR):**  
A high SNR = higher possible rates and more reliable transmission.[2]

**Interview Q:**  
Q: What is bandwidth?  
A: Bandwidth is the capacity of a medium to carry data, measured in bps. It directly affects how fast data can be transmitted.[2]

**Edge Cases:**  
- Bandwidth is limited in wireless systems due to regulatory constraints and shared spectrum.
- Bottlenecks occur if bandwidth is insufficient for data traffic, leading to congestion.

## Transmission Media and Wireless Transmission

### Wired Transmission Media

- **Twisted Pair Cable:**  
  UTP/STP; affordable, common for LANs, max range ~100m.[2]
- **Coaxial Cable:**  
  Used for cable TV and older Ethernet, better shielding, moderate cost.[2]
- **Fiber Optic Cable:**  
  Highest speed and bandwidth; immune to EMI, expensive, used for backbone connections.[1][2]

### Wireless Transmission

- **Radio Waves:**  
  Used for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, low-cost setup, susceptible to interference, limited range.[4]
- **Microwave Transmission:**  
  Used for satellite and point-to-point, good for long distances with line-of-sight.[4]
- **Infrared:**  
  Used for short-range communications (remote controls), sensitive to obstacles.[4]

### Key Challenges

- **Interference, Fading, and Obstacles:**  
  Wireless systems face signal fading, multipath propagation, and noise, which can degrade performance.[4][2]

- **Limited Bandwidth and Security:**  
  Wireless spectrum is shared, so congestion is likely. Encryption is critical for wireless data protection.[4]

**Interview Q:**  
Q: List types of transmission media and their differences.  
A: Wired: Twisted pair, coaxial, fiber optic. Wireless: radio, microwave, infrared. Differences include range, bandwidth, cost, and vulnerability to interference.[5][6][2]

**Edge Cases:**  
- Wireless networks must handle handoff between base stations, Doppler effect, and multipath fading.
- Bit errors from interference may require re-transmission or robust error correction schemes in upper layers.[4][2]

# Frequently Asked Interview Questions & Model Answers

1. **What differentiates guided and unguided transmission media?**  
   Guided (wired) uses cables for signal paths; unguided (wireless) uses electromagnetic waves in open air, making it more prone to interference.[7][6][5]

2. **What is modulation, and why is it needed?**  
   Modulation adapts signals for the chosen medium and mitigates noise/interference, enabling long-distance and wireless communication.[4][2]

3. **Explain EMI and how it affects data transmission.**  
   EMI disrupts signals on the physical medium, leading to errors. Shielding (STP, coaxial), fiber optics, and error correction can minimize its impact.[3][2]

4. **How does SNR impact bandwidth use?**  
   Higher SNR allows higher bandwidth/data rates without raising error rates; poor SNR limits throughput.[2][4]

5. **How are wireless channels different from wired?**  
   Wireless is subject to interference, dynamic range, fading, and requires spectrum management, unlike predictable wired links.[4]
