Below are concise, structured notes covering all major File System concepts for top tech interview readiness. Each topic offers focused definitions, examples, FAANG-style questions with answers, and tricky edge cases that are frequently tested.

## File System and Its Components

- A **file system** is a method and data structure used by the OS to organize, store, and retrieve files on storage devices.[1][2]
- **Key Components**:
  - **File organization**: Directories/folders to group and arrange files.
  - **File operations**: Actions such as create, read, write, delete, and rename files.
  - **Metadata**: File info (name, type, size, timestamps, permissions).
  - **Access control**: Determines who can access which files.[3]
  - **File Allocation Table/inode structure**: Maps file data to physical blocks.[3]
- Example: NTFS on Windows uses Master File Table, ext4 on Linux uses inodes.

### Interview Q&A
- Q: What is a file system?
  - A: It‚Äôs how an OS organizes, stores, and retrieves files on a storage device.[1]
- Q: What are the core components of a file system?
  - A: Directory structure, metadata, file allocation strategy, access permissions.[3]

### Tricky Edge Case
- Corruption in metadata can make files inaccessible even though data remains on disk.[1][3]

## Types of File System

- **Disk-based**: FAT, NTFS (Windows), ext4 (Linux), HFS+/APFS (macOS).
- **Flash-based**: Designed for flash drives (e.g., exFAT, F2FS).[4][5][6]
- **Network-based**: NFS (Linux), SMB (Windows).[5][6]
- **Optical/Removable Media**: ISO 9660 (CDs), UDF (DVDs).[6][5]
- **Specialized**: Database or transactional file systems, journaling file systems (e.g. ZFS, Btrfs).[7][5]

### Interview Q&A
- Q: What is the difference between NTFS and ext4?
  - A: NTFS is used in Windows with advanced permissions and journaling; ext4 is the default Linux file system with journaling and extents support.[4][5]
- Q: Why use journaling file systems?
  - A: They help recover quickly after crashes by logging recent operations.[5][7]

### Tricky Edge Case
- Some file systems have limits (file size, name length) differing between OSes‚Äîcross-platform moves can cause data loss.[4][5]

## File Allocation and Deallocation

- **Contiguous Allocation**: Stores a file in sequential disk blocks‚Äîfast access, but susceptible to external fragmentation.[8][9][10]
- **Linked Allocation**: Data blocks are linked in a chain‚Äîno external fragmentation, but only sequential access is efficient.[9][11][8]
- **Indexed Allocation**: Special index block holds pointers to file blocks‚Äîenables direct (random) access, more overhead.[11][8][9]
- **Deallocation**: Occurs when a file is deleted; blocks are returned to free space for reuse.[10][9]

### Interview Q&A
- Q: What is an advantage of indexed allocation?
  - A: Allows fast direct access to any block in a file using an index block.[9][11]
- Q: What‚Äôs a drawback of linked allocation?
  - A: Finding a block far into the file is slow, as blocks must be traversed sequentially.[11][9]

### Tricky Edge Case
- In Index allocation, corruption of the index block can cause total data loss for the file.[8][11]

***

## Fragmentation

- **Internal Fragmentation**: Wasted space within fixed-sized blocks allocated to files that don‚Äôt fully use the space.
- **External Fragmentation**: Free space scattered in small blocks between allocated files‚Äîtotal free space may be enough, but not contiguous for a new large file.[10][8]
- Contiguous allocation is especially susceptible to external fragmentation.

### Interview Q&A
- Q: What is external fragmentation? Give an example.
  - A: Free space is available but not in a large consecutive chunk‚Äîfor example, 10 free 1KB blocks scattered across disk, but no single 10KB file can be written.[8]
- Q: Which file allocation method avoids external fragmentation?
  - A: Linked and indexed allocation methods avoid external fragmentation.[9][11]

### Tricky Edge Case
- Excessive fragmentation degrades performance; defragmentation tools are sometimes needed to improve speed.[10][8]
