## Blocking vs. Non-Blocking

- **Blocking I/O:** The executing process waits (gets blocked) until the I/O operation completes‚Äîsimple to implement and reason about but may waste CPU cycles when waiting for slow devices.[1]
- **Non-Blocking I/O:** The process initiates the I/O and continues execution immediately; the system reports status back later, allowing programs to do useful work while waiting.[1]

**Example:** Reading a file with blocking I/O makes the program halt until the whole file is read, while with non-blocking I/O, it can process other tasks and receive data as it arrives.

### Interview Q&A
- Q: What is the key advantage of non-blocking I/O?
  - A: It allows a process to perform other operations while waiting for I/O to finish, improving responsiveness and CPU utilization.[1]
- Q: Give an example when blocking I/O may be preferred.
  - A: When tasks are simple and sequential, and latency is not critical (e.g., CLI tools).[1]

### Tricky Edge Case
- Non-blocking I/O can complicate error-handling and increase implementation complexity.[1]

## Synchronous vs. Asynchronous

- **Synchronous I/O:** Operations occur in order; each task must wait for the previous one to finish (blocking by design). Examples: Opening a file, reading, then only processing after data is received.[2][3]
- **Asynchronous I/O:** Operations can proceed in parallel; the program can continue while I/O happens in the background‚Äîoften relies on callbacks or events.[3][2]

**Example:** Synchronous web requests make the program wait for a response; asynchronous callbacks allow the program to do other things while waiting.

### Interview Q&A
- Q: Why use asynchronous I/O in server applications?
  - A: To handle many connections concurrently without blocking on slow I/O, boosting throughput.[2]
- Q: When is synchronous I/O better?
  - A: For dependent operations requiring strict order, or to keep code simple.[2]

### Tricky Edge Case
- Asynchronous code often introduces race conditions, especially when shared resources aren't properly synchronized.[2]

## Spooling

- **Spooling (Simultaneous Peripheral Operations On-Line):** Buffers data for slow devices (like printers or email servers) by temporarily storing it on disk, so the CPU can continue doing other tasks.[4][5]
- Jobs are queued and handled sequentially from the spool, allowing for efficient device sharing and job management.

**Example:** Multiple print jobs are spooled to disk, letting users continue other work even if the printer is busy.[5][4]

### Interview Q&A
- Q: What is the main benefit of spooling?
  - A: It allows fast devices (CPU) to work independently of slow devices (printers), maximizing resource utilization.[4]
- Q: How does spooling differ from direct I/O?
  - A: Spooling uses a queue (buffer) between process and device, while direct I/O sends data immediately, causing possible waiting.[4]

### Tricky Edge Case
- If the spool (buffer) becomes full, new jobs are delayed or rejected. Mismanagement of spool queues may also cause job starvation.
