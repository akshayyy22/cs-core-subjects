## RAID and Its Types

- **RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks):** Combines multiple disks into one logical unit to improve performance, reliability, or both by using striping, mirroring, and parity.[1][2][3]
- **Common RAID Levels**:
  - **RAID 0 (Striping):** Splits data across disks for speed, no redundancy; one disk fails, all data lost.[2][3]
  - **RAID 1 (Mirroring):** Copies data to two+ disks for fault tolerance; higher disk usage, no speed gain on writes.[3][2]
  - **RAID 5 (Striping + Parity):** Distributes data and parity for fault tolerance with efficient storage; can tolerate one disk failure.[2][3]
  - **RAID 6 (Double Parity):** Like RAID 5 but can survive two disk failures; slightly slower writes.[3][2]
  - **RAID 10 (1+0, or Mirrored Stripes):** Stripes across mirrored pairs; best mix of speed and fault-tolerance but at high cost (needs at least 4 disks).[2][3]
  - **Nested and Non-Standard Levels:** Combinations (e.g., RAID 50, 60, 03/53) and vendor-specific implementations exist for special use cases.[4]

**Example:** RAID 5 is widely used in company file servers for a balance of space and risk protection.

### Interview Q&A
- Q: What happens if a disk fails in RAID 0?
  - A: All data is lost; RAID 0 has no redundancy.[3][2]
- Q: Why use RAID 10 over RAID 5?
  - A: RAID 10 offers better write performance and fault tolerance at the cost of usable capacity.[2][3]

### Tricky Edge Case
- RAID is not a substitute for backup; accidental deletes or ransomware still destroy data regardless of RAID.[4]

## Security Threats and Vulnerabilities

- **Security Threat:** Any circumstance/event with the potential to harm system integrity, availability, or confidentiality (e.g., malware, unauthorized access, DoS attacks).[5][6][7]
- **Vulnerability:** Weakness or flaw in OS code/configuration that can be exploited by threats (e.g., buffer overflows, unpatched software, improper access controls).[8][6][5]
- **Types of Threats**:
  - Malware (viruses, ransomware, spyware)
  - Phishing & social engineering
  - Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS)
  - Insider threats
  - Eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.[9][8]
- **Types of Vulnerabilities**:
  - Buffer overflows, injection flaws, privilege escalation, zero-days, misconfigurations.[5][8]
- **Consequences:** Data breach, system compromise, financial loss, loss of reputation.[6][8]

**Example:** WannaCry ransomware spread due to an unpatched MS Windows vulnerability, locking files for ransom worldwide.[8]

### Interview Q&A
- Q: What's a buffer overflow vulnerability?
  - A: When a process writes past buffer boundaries, possibly leading to arbitrary code execution.[5][8]
- Q: How does RAID help with data protection?
  - A: Provides fault tolerance against hardware failure, but does not guard against malware or accidental deletions.[3][2]

### Tricky Edge Cases
- Zero-day exploits are especially dangerous: attackers can compromise systems before patches exist.[8]
- Even secure setups can be undone by weak passwords or user error (phishing/insiders).[8]
