# **1. Define Network**

A **network** is a group of two or more devices (like computers, phones, routers) that are **connected together** so they can **share information, files, and resources**.

**One-line formula:**
**Network = devices + connection + communication**

---

# **2. What is Network Topology?**

**Network topology** means the **way devices (nodes) are arranged and connected** in a network — like the layout or structure.

Think of it as the **map/design** of a network.

---

# **Types of Network Topologies (Simple Explanation)**

### **1. Bus Topology**

* All computers are connected to **one main cable**.
* If the main cable breaks → whole network fails.

**Analogy:**
Like a straight road where all houses are connected along the same road.

---

### **2. Star Topology**

* All devices are connected to a **central device** (switch or hub).
* If the central device fails → whole network fails.

**Analogy:**
Like fans in a room all connected to one switch board.

---

### **3. Ring Topology**

* Devices are connected in a **circle**.
* Data moves in one direction around the ring.

**Analogy:**
Like passing a ball around in a circle.

---

### **4. Mesh Topology**

* Every device is connected to **every other device**.
* No single point of failure → very reliable.

**Analogy:**
Like many roads connecting between many cities.

---

### **5. Tree (Hierarchical) Topology**

* Combination of **star** topologies arranged in a **hierarchy**.

**Analogy:**
Like a family tree.

---

### **6. Hybrid Topology**

* Mixture of two or more types of topologies.

---

# **3. Define Bandwidth, Node, and Link**

### **Bandwidth**

The **maximum amount of data** that can be transmitted in 1 second.
Higher bandwidth = faster network.

**Analogy:**
Bigger water pipe = more water flows = higher bandwidth.

---

### **Node**

Any **device** connected to a network.

Examples:
Computer, router, printer, phone — all are nodes.

---

### **Link**

The **connection** between two nodes.

Examples:
Cables, Wi-Fi signals, optical fiber.

---

# **4. Explain TCP/IP Model (Simple Words)**

TCP/IP model is a **4-layer framework** that explains how data moves across the internet.

### **Layers (Top to Bottom)**

### **1. Application Layer**

* Where user apps work (browser, email, WhatsApp).
* Provides interfaces to send/receive data.

**Think:** This is where you use internet services.

---

### **2. Transport Layer**

* Breaks data into **small packets**.
* Ensures **reliable delivery** (TCP) or **fast delivery** (UDP).

**Think:** Delivery boy ensuring your parcels reach correctly.

---

### **3. Internet Layer**

* Finds the **best route** for data.
* Uses **IP addresses**.

**Think:** Google Maps deciding the best path for your parcel.

---

### **4. Network Access (Link) Layer**

* Deals with **actual hardware transmission**.
* Uses MAC address, cables, Wi-Fi signals.

**Think:** Roads on which vehicles travel.

---

# **5. OSI Model (EXPLAINED IN SUPER SIMPLE WORDS)**

**OSI** = Open Systems Interconnection
It has **7 layers**. Think of it like **7 steps** to send data.

---

## 🔹 **Layer 7 – Application**

* Apps you use: browser, WhatsApp.
* Provides internet services.

---

## 🔹 **Layer 6 – Presentation**

* Converts data into a format devices can understand.
* Encryption, compression.

**Think:** Translator.

---

## 🔹 **Layer 5 – Session**

* Opens, maintains, and closes communication.
* Controls dialogues between computers.

**Think:** Start call → talk → end call.

---

## 🔹 **Layer 4 – Transport**

* Breaks data into packets.
* Ensures reliable delivery (TCP) or fast delivery (UDP).

**Think:** Delivery service.

---

## 🔹 **Layer 3 – Network**

* Handles IP addresses and routing.
* Finds the best path.

**Think:** Maps + addresses.

---

## 🔹 **Layer 2 – Data Link**

* Converts packets into frames.
* Uses MAC address.
* Handles error detection.

**Think:** Street names and building numbers.

---

## 🔹 **Layer 1 – Physical**

* Actual transmission: cables, electricity, radio waves.

**Think:** Roads, wires, signals.
